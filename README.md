# Python scripts in GitHub Actions

Learn how to run Python scripts on GitHub Actions! This allows you to handle logic that might be a bit more complex, like setting conditional behavior based on results.

Although GitHub actions is powerful as-is, it can get complicated when consuming inputs from other sources like an HTTP request providing JSON output.

Imagine a scenario where, depending on the JSON output of an HTTP request you have to do an API call. You might be able to do this with a specialized action or workflow, but with Python it might be easier.
